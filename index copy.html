            <p> The Beatles' Please Please Me album was rush-released by Parlophone on 22nd March, 1963 to capitalise on the enormous success of the title track which had been the group's second single and their first no. 1 in the majority of UK charts.

            <p>Friday 22nd November, 1963 is still remembered by many, who lived through it as the day that President John F. Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas, Texas. Earlier on that eventful day, Parlophone had released the Beatles' second album. This album included the song-writing debut of their twenty-year old, Lead Guitarist, George Harrison.</p>

            <p> Released on 10th July, 1964, the Beatles third album in less than eighteen months was timed to coincide with the cinema opening of their first movie.
            Of the album's 13 tracks seven were featured in the soundtrack of the film</p>

            <p> No single was released in the UK from Beatles For Sale - the non-album tracks "I Feel Fine" and "She's A Woman" performed that role - however, that coupling was followed-up in the US by "Eight Day's A Week" (b/w " I Don't Want To Spoil The Party") which became their 7th #1 in March 1965.</p>

            <img src="images/download-3.jpg" alt="Beatles fifth album, Help" width="150">
            <p>Released on 6th August, 1965, and eight months after Beatles For Sale, the recordings for Help! had actually started in earnest in mid February just one month after the guys had completed a season of 'Another Beatles Christmas Show' at London's Hammersmith Odeon. Within days of the final February session, they were off to the Bahamas to film scenes for the movie, which like 'A Hard Day's Night' was directed by Richard Lester.</p>

            <p> Rubber Soul was another album for Christmas - released on 3rd December, 1965 just two weeks after final mixing had taken place. Following the release of their previous album The Beatles had undertaken a momentous tour of the USA and Canada including a record breaking appearance at New York's famous Shea Stadium.</p>

            <p> The Beatles' seventh album was released in early August 1966. Following the release of Rubber Soul the group had embarked on what was to be their final UK concert tour and following a lengthy break, they returned to Abbey Road to record continually for three months. The first recordings released from these sessions, engineered by Geoff Emerick, was the single "Paperback Writer" and "Rain" and those tracks gave an indication of what was to come.</p>

Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, the band's eighth album became the soundtrack to the "summer of love" but its appeal is timeless. Work had begun on the recording in late 1966 and at one stage it was thought that both Penny Lane and Strawberry Fields Forever would also be included but when these were released as a single in February, that idea was abandoned.

            <p> The Beatles devised, wrote and directed a television film called Magical Mystery Tour which was broadcast on BBC Television at Christmas, 1967. Even before Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, had hit the shops, the idea of the programme had been born and work had commenced on the title track.</p>
